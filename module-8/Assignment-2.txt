Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to actively contribute to open-source Ethereum projects or initiatives. By participating in open-source development, students gain hands-on experience, strengthen their skills, and contribute to the growth of the Ethereum community.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Explain the significance of contributing to open-source projects in the Ethereum ecosystem.
Emphasize that open-source contributions allow students to collaborate with experienced developers, improve their skills, and make a meaningful impact.
Providing a List of Open-Source Ethereum Projects:

Provide students with a list of open-source Ethereum projects, initiatives, or repositories that are actively seeking contributions.
Projects can include Ethereum Foundation projects, popular Solidity libraries on GitHub, Ethereum clients (e.g., Geth, Parity), or decentralized applications (DApps) with open repositories.
