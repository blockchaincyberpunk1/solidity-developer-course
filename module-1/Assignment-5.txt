Ethereum Etherscan Transaction Analysis

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to enhance students' ability to explore Ethereum transactions and smart contracts using Etherscan, a blockchain explorer.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Explain the purpose of the assignment, which is to familiarize students with Ethereum transaction analysis using Etherscan.
Emphasize the importance of understanding transaction details for Solidity developers.
Transaction Search:

Instruct students to visit the Etherscan website (etherscan.io) or any similar Ethereum blockchain explorer.
Task them with searching for a recent Ethereum transaction by transaction hash, sender/receiver address, or other criteria of their choice.
Transaction Analysis:

Guide students in analyzing the transaction details. They should focus on the following aspects:
Sender and receiver addresses.
Transaction status (success/failure).
Gas usage and gas fees.
Contract interactions (if the transaction involves a smart contract).
Input and output data, if available.
Transaction Insights:

Ask students to provide insights and conclusions based on their analysis. They should consider questions such as:
What was the purpose of this transaction?
Was it a simple Ether transfer or an interaction with a smart contract?
Did the transaction succeed or fail, and why?
How much gas was used, and was it reasonable for the transaction's complexity?
Report Submission:

Request students to write a brief report summarizing their findings from the transaction analysis.
The report should include transaction details, insights gained, and any interesting observations.
Peer Review:

Optionally, you can organize a peer review session where students can exchange and review each other's reports to gain different perspectives.
Discussion and Reflection:

Hold a class discussion or reflection session where students can share their findings, discuss interesting transactions they analyzed, and explore any challenges they encountered during the analysis.
Assessment Criteria:

Accurate transaction analysis, including sender/receiver addresses, transaction status, gas usage, and contract interactions (if applicable).
Well-structured and insightful report summarizing the transaction analysis.
Participation in class discussions and sharing of experiences.
