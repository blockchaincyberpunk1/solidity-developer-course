Ethereum Smart Contract Deployment and Interaction

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with the process of deploying Ethereum smart contracts to a testnet and interacting with them using transactions.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Explain the purpose of the assignment, which is to introduce students to Ethereum smart contract deployment and interaction.
Emphasize that this assignment will use a testnet (e.g., Ropsten or Rinkeby) to avoid real Ether usage.
Smart Contract Code Template:

Provide students with a simple Ethereum smart contract code template. This could be a basic "Hello, Ethereum" contract or any other straightforward example.
Ensure that the contract includes functions that can be called by external accounts.
Deployment Process:

Guide students through the deployment process using a development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
Explain how to compile the contract code, connect to a testnet, and deploy the contract.
Provide instructions on specifying constructor parameters (if any) during deployment.
Contract Interaction Task:

Assign a specific interaction task to students. For example, they might be asked to call a function on the deployed contract that returns a value or updates the contract's state.
Specify the input parameters and expected output for the interaction task.
Transaction Cost Analysis:

Instruct students to observe and analyze the transaction cost associated with their contract interaction. They should consider gas costs, transaction fees, and the Ethereum gas price.
Evaluation:

Assess students' ability to:
Deploy the provided smart contract to a testnet.
Successfully interact with the deployed contract by following the specified task.
Analyze and understand the transaction cost details.
Submission:

Ask students to submit evidence of their completed contract deployment and interaction, including transaction IDs or screenshots.
Discussion and Reflection:

Organize a class discussion or reflection session where students can share their experiences, discuss transaction costs, and highlight any challenges they encountered during deployment and interaction.
Assessment Criteria:

Accurate deployment of the smart contract to a testnet.
Successful completion of the assigned contract interaction task.
Understanding of transaction costs and gas fees in the Ethereum network.
