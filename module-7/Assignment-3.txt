Automated Testing for Deployment

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to automate the testing process for smart contracts before deployment. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in setting up automated tests using Truffle or Hardhat to ensure the correctness and reliability of smart contracts before deployment.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the importance of automated testing in the smart contract development lifecycle.
Emphasize the significance of ensuring that contracts behave as expected before they are deployed to the blockchain.
Provided Truffle or Hardhat Project:

Provide students with a Truffle or Hardhat project that contains multiple smart contracts.
Ensure that the project includes a variety of contracts with different functionalities and interactions.
Task Description:

Task students with the following steps:
Configure automated tests for the provided smart contracts to ensure they behave as expected.
Write tests that cover various contract interactions, edge cases, and potential vulnerabilities.
Develop deployment scripts that will only deploy the contracts to the blockchain if all automated tests pass successfully.
Writing Automated Tests:

Instruct students to write automated tests using the chosen testing framework (Truffle or Hardhat).
Encourage them to create tests that thoroughly validate the contracts' behavior, including positive and negative scenarios.
Emphasize the importance of testing contract interactions, state changes, and any critical functions.
Test Coverage and Edge Cases:

Task students with paying special attention to test coverage and edge cases.
Instruct them to identify and test scenarios that might not be immediately obvious but could impact the contract's behavior.
Deployment Scripts:

Guide students on how to write deployment scripts that automate the deployment process.
Explain how these scripts should check the results of automated tests before initiating deployment.
Ensure that students include clear instructions for using these deployment scripts.
Test Execution and Deployment:

Instruct students on how to execute their automated tests and deployment scripts within the Truffle or Hardhat environment.
Ask them to provide evidence of successful test execution and deployment, including screenshots or logs.
Submission Requirements:

Students should submit the following:
Automated test scripts for the provided smart contracts.
Deployment scripts that incorporate test validation.
Evidence of test execution and successful deployment.
Assessment:

Evaluate students' submissions based on the following criteria:
Thoroughness and correctness of automated tests.
Coverage of contract interactions and edge cases.
Proper configuration and execution of deployment scripts.
Successful deployment of contracts only when all tests pass.
Feedback and Assistance:

Provide feedback on students' test scripts, coverage, and deployment processes.
Offer assistance and guidance to students who encounter challenges in configuring automated tests or deployment scripts.
