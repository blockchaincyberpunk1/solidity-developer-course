Smart Contract Deployment on the Ethereum Mainnet

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to prepare students for real-world deployment scenarios by guiding them through the process of deploying a smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet. By completing this assignment, students will gain practical experience in deploying smart contracts in a production environment, ensuring they are well-equipped for blockchain development projects.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the significance of deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet.
Emphasize that deploying to the mainnet involves real Ether and is the final step in bringing a blockchain project to life.
Choosing a Real-Use Smart Contract:

Instruct students to choose a real-use smart contract for this assignment. Examples include:
An ERC-20 token contract.
A decentralized application (DApp) contract.
A smart contract used for a specific blockchain project.
Deployment on the Ethereum Mainnet:

Guide students through the process of deploying the selected smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet.
Ensure they understand the following aspects:
The use of their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to facilitate the deployment.
Configuration of gas fees and gas limits.
Transaction confirmation and the significance of waiting for confirmations.
Documentation of Deployment Process:

Require students to document the entire deployment process comprehensively.
The documentation should include:
Transaction hashes for the contract deployment on the Ethereum mainnet.
The contract's address on the mainnet.
A detailed description of the contract's purpose and functionality.
Gas costs for the deployment transaction.
Source Code Verification:

Instruct students to verify the source code of the deployed smart contract on a blockchain explorer platform like Etherscan.
Ensure they understand the process of source code verification and its importance for transparency.
Submission Requirements:

Students should submit the following:
Documentation of the deployment process, including transaction hashes and contract addresses.
A brief summary of the contract's functionality and purpose.
Gas cost breakdown and any notable observations during deployment.
Evidence of source code verification (e.g., a link to the verified contract on Etherscan).
Assessment:

Evaluate students' submissions based on the following criteria:
Accuracy and completeness of the deployment process documentation.
Successful source code verification.
Reflection on their experiences during the deployment process and insights gained.
Feedback and Assistance:

Provide feedback on the accuracy of students' deployments and source code verification.
Offer assistance to students who encounter challenges during the deployment process or need clarification on any aspect of the assignment.
