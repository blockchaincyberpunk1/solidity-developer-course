Solidity Constructor Functions

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to use constructor functions in Solidity to initialize contract state variables during contract deployment.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the purpose of the assignment, which is to familiarize students with Solidity constructor functions.
Emphasize the importance of constructors in initializing contract state variables when a contract is deployed.
Contract Template:

Provide students with a Solidity contract template that includes state variables without initial values.
Specify the state variables that need to be initialized in the constructor.
Writing the Constructor Function:

Instruct students to write a constructor function within the contract template. The constructor should:
Accept input parameters, if necessary, to set the initial values of state variables.
Initialize the state variables with appropriate values based on the constructor's logic.
Deployment and Testing:

Encourage students to deploy the contract on a testnet (e.g., Ropsten) or a local development blockchain.
Ask them to verify that the state variables are correctly initialized by interacting with the deployed contract.
Code Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of code documentation. Require students to add comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the constructor function.
Scenario Specifics:

Provide any additional details or constraints related to the scenario that require specific initialization logic in the constructor.
Submission:

Request students to submit their Solidity smart contract code along with a description of how their constructor function initializes state variables and any testing results.
Assessment Criteria:

Correct implementation of the constructor function.
Proper initialization of state variables.
Clarity of code documentation.
Successful deployment and testing of the contract.
