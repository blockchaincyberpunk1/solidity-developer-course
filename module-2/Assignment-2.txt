Solidity Control Structures

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to enhance students' proficiency in using control structures in Solidity, including conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while). Students will apply these control structures to address a real-world scenario within a Solidity smart contract.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Explain the purpose of the assignment, which is to strengthen students' ability to use control structures effectively in Solidity contracts.
Highlight the significance of control structures in programming and how they can be applied in blockchain smart contracts.
Scenario Description:

Present a real-world scenario that requires the use of control structures. For example, simulate a simple voting system where users can cast votes for different candidates.
Contract Template:

Share a basic Solidity contract template with students. The template should include placeholders for variables, functions, and control structures.
Specify the variables needed for the scenario, such as candidate names, vote counters, and voter records.
Implementing Control Structures:

Task students with implementing control structures in the contract to address the scenario. They should:
Use conditional statements (if-else) to check conditions like whether a voter is eligible to vote or if a candidate exists.
Use loops (for, while) to handle multiple votes or iterate through candidate lists.
Testing and Deployment:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their contract using a development environment like Remix or Truffle.
Instruct them to deploy the contract on a testnet (e.g., Ropsten) or a local development blockchain for testing.
Code Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of code documentation. Require students to add comments explaining the purpose and functionality of control structures and variables.
Scenario Specifics:

Provide any additional details or constraints related to the scenario, such as the number of votes each voter can cast or how candidate names are stored.
Submission:

Request students to submit their Solidity smart contract code along with a brief description of how their contract addresses the given scenario and any challenges they encountered.
Assessment Criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the contract in addressing the scenario.
Proper use of Solidity control structures (if-else, loops).
Clarity of code documentation.
Testing and deployment on a development blockchain.
