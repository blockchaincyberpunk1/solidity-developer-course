Full-Stack DApp Development

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to build a complete decentralized application (DApp) that includes both the smart contract and front-end components. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in developing a functional DApp from scratch, covering smart contract development, user interface design, and blockchain interaction.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the purpose of the assignment, which is to create a full-stack DApp with both smart contract and front-end components.
Emphasize the importance of integrating smart contracts with user-friendly interfaces to create user-centric DApps.
DApp Concept and Smart Contract:

Provide students with a DApp concept or use case (e.g., a decentralized voting platform) that they will implement.
Task students with designing, developing, and deploying the smart contract for the DApp.
Ensure that the contract's functions and data structures align with the DApp's requirements.
Front-End Development:

Instruct students to create a user-friendly front-end interface for interacting with the DApp.
Task them with implementing forms, buttons, and other UI components to allow users to interact with the smart contract.
Guide them on using web3.js to connect the front end to the Ethereum blockchain and handle contract interactions.
Integration and Testing:

Emphasize the importance of proper integration between the smart contract and front-end components.
Instruct students to thoroughly test the DApp on a testnet (e.g., Ropsten) to ensure its functionality.
Encourage them to test various scenarios, including transaction failures and edge cases.
Deployment:

Require students to deploy the DApp (both the smart contract and front-end) to a testnet.
Ensure they provide clear instructions on how to access and use the deployed DApp.
Documentation and Presentation:

Ask students to document their development process, including any design decisions, challenges faced, and how they overcame them.
Encourage them to create a presentation or video demonstration showcasing their DApp's functionality and features.
Submission Requirements:

Ask students to submit the following:
The complete source code of the smart contract.
The front-end code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for their DApp's user interface.
Documentation of the DApp's functionality, including how to use it.
A video demonstration or presentation explaining their DApp and its features.
Assessment:

Evaluate students' submissions based on the following criteria:
Functionality and correctness of the smart contract.
Usability and user-friendliness of the front-end interface.
Successful integration between the contract and front-end.
Proper documentation and presentation of the DApp.
Feedback and Assistance:

Provide feedback on students' submissions, highlighting areas of excellence and areas for improvement.
Offer assistance and guidance to students who encounter difficulties during development or deployment.
