DApp Front-End Development

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to front-end development for decentralized applications (DApps) using web3.js, HTML, and CSS. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in building a user-friendly interface for interacting with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the purpose of the assignment, which is to enable students to create a front-end interface for interacting with a smart contract.
Emphasize the importance of user-friendly interfaces in DApps and how they enhance the user experience.
Smart Contract Interaction:

Provide students with a sample smart contract that includes functions they need to interact with (e.g., reading data or sending transactions).
Ensure that the contract's functions are well-documented so students understand their purpose and inputs.
Front-End Development:

Task students with the following objectives:
Create a front-end interface (HTML/CSS) that allows users to interact with the provided smart contract.
Implement user-friendly forms or buttons to call contract functions and display relevant data.
Use web3.js to establish a connection to the Ethereum blockchain and handle contract interactions.
Include proper error handling to provide feedback to users in case of transaction failures or other issues.
Integration with Smart Contract:

Instruct students on how to use web3.js to integrate their front-end interface with the smart contract.
Provide guidance on how to make function calls, send transactions, and retrieve data from the contract within the front-end.
User-Friendly Feedback:

Emphasize the importance of user-friendly feedback and error messages in the interface.
Encourage students to implement clear and informative messages for users, especially in case of transaction failures or errors.
Submission Requirements:

Ask students to submit the following:
The complete front-end code (HTML/CSS) for their DApp interface.
Documentation or comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the interface components.
Screenshots or video demonstrations showcasing the DApp's functionality and interaction with the smart contract.
Assessment:

Evaluate students' submissions based on the following criteria:
Usability and user-friendliness of the front-end interface.
Correct integration of web3.js to interact with the smart contract.
Proper error handling and feedback to users.
Successful demonstration of the DApp's functionality and interaction with the contract.
Feedback and Assistance:

Provide feedback on students' submissions, highlighting any areas that may need improvement.
Offer assistance and guidance to students who encounter difficulties during front-end development or integration.
