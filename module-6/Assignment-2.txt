Smart Contract Development

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to create and deploy a smart contract using Solidity. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in designing, implementing, testing, and deploying a basic smart contract. They will also learn how to write unit tests to ensure the contract's functionality and integrity.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the purpose of the assignment, which is to enable students to apply their Solidity knowledge to develop a functioning smart contract.
Emphasize the importance of smart contracts in blockchain development and their real-world applications.
Smart Contract Specification:

Provide students with a simple smart contract specification. For example, you can specify a basic token contract or a voting contract.
Include clear and detailed requirements for the smart contract, such as its functions, state variables, and expected behavior.
Smart Contract Implementation:

Task students with the following objectives:
Implement the specified smart contract using Solidity.
Ensure that the contract adheres to the provided requirements.
Write clean, well-structured, and documented code.
Encourage students to use best practices and security considerations in their implementations.
Unit Testing:

Instruct students to write comprehensive unit tests for their smart contract using the Truffle framework.
Emphasize the importance of testing to ensure that the contract functions as intended and to identify and fix potential issues.
Local Blockchain Deployment:

Guide students through deploying their smart contract to a local Ganache blockchain for testing.
Instruct them on how to interact with the contract using Truffle console or other appropriate tools.
Submission Requirements:

Ask students to submit the following:
The complete Solidity code of their smart contract.
A set of unit tests for the contract.
Documentation or comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the contract and its functions.
Screenshots or evidence of the contract being successfully deployed and tested on a local Ganache blockchain.
Assessment:

Evaluate students' submissions based on the following criteria:
Correctness and functionality of the smart contract (adherence to specifications).
Quality and coverage of unit tests (thoroughly tested contract functions).
Code quality, including readability and documentation.
Successful deployment and interaction with the contract on a local Ganache blockchain.
Feedback and Assistance:

Provide feedback on students' submissions, highlighting any areas that may need improvement.
Offer assistance and guidance to students who encounter difficulties during development or testing.
