Event-Driven Functions

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce students' understanding of events in Solidity by building functions that are driven by emitted events. Students will work on a scenario where a contract needs to respond to specific events. They will write functions that execute actions in response to these events, emit the triggering events, and demonstrate the execution of event-driven functions.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the concept of event-driven programming in the context of Solidity contracts.
Emphasize that events can be used to notify and trigger functions that respond to specific contract events.
Contract Scenario:

Provide students with a scenario where a contract needs to respond to specific events. For example, you can simulate a contract that manages a supply chain, and events represent different supply chain milestones.
Specify the events that need to be emitted and the actions or state changes that should be triggered in response to these events.
Contract Setup:

Provide students with a Solidity contract template that includes state variables and functions for handling the specified events.
Ensure that the contract is well-documented, including clear explanations of the events and their expected outcomes.
Event Implementation:

Task students with implementing events within the contract code. Each event should correspond to a specific contract event or milestone.
Instruct them to use the emit keyword to trigger these events whenever the corresponding actions or state changes occur.
Event-Driven Functions:

Ask students to write Solidity functions that respond to the emitted events. These functions should execute actions or state changes based on the event data.
Ensure that students properly define and call these functions to simulate the responses to the events.
Triggering Events:

Instruct students to write functions that simulate the events by executing actions or state changes.
Ensure that these functions emit the corresponding events with relevant data.
Demonstration:

Encourage students to demonstrate the functioning of their contract by triggering events and observing the execution of event-driven functions.
Request them to provide clear examples or scenarios where the events are triggered, and the contract responds accordingly.
Code Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of code documentation for both events and event-driven functions. Require students to add comments explaining the purpose of each event and the response functions.
Testing and Validation:

Encourage students to test their contract by deploying it on a testnet or using a local development blockchain.
Request them to document their testing process and provide evidence of successful event triggering and function responses.
Submission:

Request students to submit the Solidity smart contract code, the code for triggering events, and a summary of their testing and validation process.
Assessment Criteria:

Correct implementation of events and event-driven functions within the contract.
Proper triggering of events and execution of event-driven functions.
Clear demonstration of event-driven functionality with examples or scenarios.
Clarity of code documentation and explanations.
