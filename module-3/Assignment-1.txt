Basic Function Definition and Interaction

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to define functions and interact with them within a Solidity contract. Students will practice defining functions that perform basic arithmetic operations or data manipulations, calling these functions within the contract, and managing state variables.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Begin by explaining the purpose of the assignment, which is to introduce students to function definition and interaction in Solidity.
Emphasize the importance of functions in smart contracts for performing various tasks.
Contract Template:

Provide students with a simple Solidity contract template that includes state variables and placeholders for functions.
Specify the state variables and outline the functions that should be defined.
Function Definitions:

Task students with defining functions within the contract that perform basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) or data manipulations (e.g., string concatenation).
Ensure that each function has clear input parameters and a well-defined purpose.
Function Interaction:

Instruct students to call the functions they defined within the contract itself.
Encourage them to use the functions to manipulate state variables. For example, they can use a function to update the value of a state variable based on the result of an arithmetic operation.
Testing and Validation:

Encourage students to test their contract by deploying it on a testnet (e.g., Ropsten or Rinkeby) or using a local development blockchain.
Ask them to demonstrate how the defined functions can be invoked and how state variables are updated as a result.
Code Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of code documentation. Require students to add comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function.
Submission:

Request students to submit the Solidity smart contract code along with a description of the functions they defined, how these functions interact with state variables, and testing results.
Assessment Criteria:

Correct implementation of functions with clear input parameters and logic.
Proper interaction with state variables using the defined functions.
Successful deployment and testing of the contract.
Clarity of code documentation.
