Reentrancy Vulnerability Mitigation

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students about the reentrancy vulnerability in smart contracts and how to prevent it. Students will be provided with a vulnerable smart contract containing a reentrancy issue. Their task is to identify and fix the vulnerability, ensuring that the contract no longer suffers from reentrancy problems. Students will demonstrate the corrected contract's behavior and provide an explanation of how they mitigated the reentrancy issue, reinforcing their understanding of this critical security concern.

Instructions:

Introduction to the Assignment:

Start by explaining the purpose of the assignment, which is to understand the reentrancy vulnerability in smart contracts and learn how to prevent it.
Emphasize the importance of mitigating reentrancy issues to secure smart contracts.
Vulnerable Smart Contract:

Provide students with a Solidity smart contract that contains a reentrancy vulnerability.
Clearly document the vulnerable portion of the contract code and describe how the reentrancy issue can be exploited.
Task Description:

Task students with the following objectives:
Identify the reentrancy vulnerability within the provided contract.
Fix the vulnerability to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
Ensure that the corrected contract operates securely without reentrancy problems.
Code Mitigation and Explanation:

Ask students to provide the corrected Solidity smart contract code, including the modifications made to mitigate the reentrancy issue.
Instruct them to provide comments or an explanation of how they fixed the vulnerability, emphasizing the security measures taken.
Demonstration and Testing:

Encourage students to demonstrate the corrected contract's behavior by deploying it on a testnet or using a local development blockchain.
Request them to conduct testing to show that the contract no longer suffers from reentrancy problems.
Students should document their testing process and provide evidence of secure contract execution.
Code Documentation:

Highlight the importance of clear and detailed code documentation, particularly in explaining the reentrancy vulnerability and how it was resolved.
Request students to provide comprehensive comments and explanations within their code.
Submission:

Ask students to submit the corrected Solidity smart contract code along with their explanations and testing results.
Assessment Criteria:

Correct identification and mitigation of the reentrancy vulnerability within the provided contract.
Accurate and secure code modifications to prevent reentrancy issues.
Clear documentation and explanations of the vulnerability resolution.
Successful testing and validation of the corrected contract, demonstrating its security.
